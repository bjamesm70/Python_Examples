<head><title>Aggregation Example</title></head>
<body><h1>Aggregation</h1><p>Unlike <strong>composition</strong>, aggregation uses existing instances of objects to build up another object.</p><p>The aggregated object doesn't actually own the objects that were used to create it.  If the object is destroyed, the objects w/i it, continue to exist!</p></body>
